Structural Design Pattern(MVVM) Of App
This app is build in MVVM structural design pattern where data source is Model, activities and fragments is View or the user interface and ViewModel class is ViewModel. Live data is wrapper that can hold any type of data including list and it can be observed by the UI controller.All layers are modulare and decoupled from each other and every part has well defined resposibilities.
